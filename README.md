# Raphunt

Raphunt is a web application which finds all of the fresh rap and hip hop songs in the past week so you dont have to. 

## How it Works

Raphunt uses the Reddit API to access posts in [r/HipHopHeads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/), a lively community of hip hop enthusiasts who are always quick to post new and trending song releases. Raphunt finds such posts, parses the title and link, and then shows them to you. Simple as that.
